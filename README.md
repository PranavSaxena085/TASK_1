Hi! 👋
This is my submission for Internship Task 1, where I had to create a database. I chose the E-commerce domain myself and created the schema using SQL.

🛠️ What I Did:
I used MySQL Workbench (local instance) to write SQL queries.

I created a new database called E_Commerce.

*Then I Designed five tables:
 1.Customer – stores customer info
 2.Product – stores product info
 3.OrderTable – stores order details
 4.OrderDetails – links orders to products
 5.Payment – stores payment info for each order

*I added primary keys to each table and used foreign keys to define the relationships.

*Table Relationships:
 One customer can place many orders
 One order can include many products
 One product can be part of many orders
 Each order can have one payment

*What I’m Submitting (Deliverables):
✅ TASK 1 (DOMAIN - E_COMMERCE).sql – My SQL script that creates the full schema
✅ TASK 1 (DOMAIN - E_COMMERCE) (ER).png – ER diagram showing all tables and relationships

*Key Concepts Used:
 DDL (Data Definition Language)
 Normalization (3rd Normal Form)
 ER Diagrams
